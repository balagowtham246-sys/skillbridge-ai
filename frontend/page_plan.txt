1️⃣ Home.jsx  
   - Page for user input: current skills + goal role  
   - Has a form with text fields and a "Generate Path" button  
   - Sends data to FastAPI backend and navigates to Results page  

2️⃣ Result.jsx  
   - Displays the AI-generated learning path (courses + durations)  
   - Has "Copy Path" and "Download PDF" buttons  
   - Uses clean, card-based layout
